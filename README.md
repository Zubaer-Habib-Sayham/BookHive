# BookHive
BookHive is a community-driven book sharing platform. Users can add books, exchange them for a set time, borrow with credits (3000 free at signup), and review each other after trades. A smart search and filter system makes finding books by title, author, genre, rating, or credit price simple.

****Introduction****

BookHive is a book sharing platform where users can share their books for a certain limit of time with each other. When a user logs in he sees:

**Add Book:** A user can add their books here in the website for exchange and credit offers. If the user doesn’t want to sell the book via credit but only add for exchange he can do that cause giving a credit price is optional here.

**Exchange:** Here users share books among each other for a certain period of time. For example, “Sayham” wants to exchange his book “A Kite Runner” with “Habiba”(’s) book “Harry Potter”. When Sayham requests for the book for a certain period of time(Given by Sayham in the request form) Habiba can confirm or reject the offer. If she confirms → Sayham gets “Harry Potter” and Habiba gets “A Kite Runner”. If canceled → Nobody gets the books. The books once again become available in the exchange tab.

**Rating & Review System:** If successful exchange happens → after the deadline ends → both users are forced to review each other by filling a review form whenever they log in after the deadline. User1 rates and writes reviews on User2 and the book he got from User2. Same for User2 as well. And based on that rating the average rating of the books and users is shown all over the website when needed.

**Credit Offers:** Till now, the website has a drawback, What if a user wants a book but has no book to share himself or nobody wants his shared book! That’s not gonna work! So the Credit System is introduced. When a user Sign Up for the first time into the website they are given free 3000 credits. Also users can lend their books for a limited time to other users without giving a book in exchange, they can just provide it in exchange of some credits. Thus they can earn more credits. Also any user now can have their desired books without exchanging if they have enough credits.

**Multifunctional Search Bar:** Also all over the website there’s a multifunctional search bar where a user can search a book by title, author or genre and also sort their search by Rating, Credit Price, Title, Author, Genre in Ascending or Descending order just like a filter button in most websites.
